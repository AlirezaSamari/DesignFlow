The image below illustrates the geometry of the co-flow system used in our design automation tool. 
We use specific aspect ratios and dimensionless numbers as key features in our predictions:

- **$ \\displaystyle l^* = \\frac{l_d}{l_{Design}} $**: Ratio of droplet size to design length.
- **$ \\displaystyle R^* = \\frac{R}{l_{Design}} $**: Dimensionless radius of curvature.
- **$ \\displaystyle \\mu^* = \\frac{\\mu_d}{\\mu_c} $**: Ratio of droplet viscosity to continuous phase viscosity.
- **$ \\displaystyle Q^* = \\frac{Q_d}{Q_c} $**: Ratio of droplet flow rate to continuous phase flow rate.
- **$ \\displaystyle Ca_c = \\frac{\\mu_c u_c}{\\sigma} $**: Capillary number of the continuous phase.
- **$ \\displaystyle We_d = \\frac{\\rho_d u_d^2 l_{Design}}{\\sigma} $**: Weber number of the droplet phase.
- **$ \\displaystyle St = \\frac{fl_{Design}}{u_c} $**: Strouhal number of the flow.
